## Project Overview
The Client Management System is a C#.NET Windows Forms application designed to manage client details efficiently. The application integrates with a SQL Server database to store and manipulate client information. Additionally, the application includes a feature to export client data to an Excel sheet, which can be saved directly to the user's desktop.

## Features
- **Add Client Details**: Users can add new client information to the database, including name, contact details, and other relevant data.
- **Update Client Details**: Users can update existing client information in the database to keep records up-to-date.
- **Export to Excel**: Users can create an Excel sheet of the client database table and save it on their desktop for easy access and reporting.
